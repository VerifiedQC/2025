The First Workshop on Verification of Quantum Computing (VQC 2025) aims to bring together researchers from formal methods and quantum information to address the unique challenges of verifying quantum software and hardware. As quantum computing continues to advance—with breakthroughs from companies like IBM, Google, and Quantinuum, along with developments in quantum algorithms for cryptography, optimization, and simulation—the need for rigorous verification techniques has never been more urgent.

This workshop seeks to foster collaboration between the formal methods and quantum computing communities by promoting the development of scalable verification techniques and tools. By providing a dedicated forum for researchers and practitioners, VQC 2025 aims to:

- Exchange ideas on the latest research in quantum verification
- Discuss challenges and potential solutions for verifying quantum systems
- Bridge the gap between quantum computing and formal verification communities
- Advance the development of tools and frameworks for verifying and simulating quantum programs

## Workshop Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Formal verification of quantum programs
- Validation and benchmarking of quantum computing systems 
- High-level quantum programming languages
- Novel quantum programming abstractions
- Quantum circuit and program optimization
- Hardware-aware circuit compilation and routing
- Error handling, mitigation, and correction
- Quantum program and circuit simulation

## Submissions

We invite prospective speakers to submit their talk proposals. It should include a two-page summary (exclude the bibliography and appendices), along with an optional link to a separate published paper or preprint.
All submissions will be handled via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vqc2025).
